'''
The diagram below shows a dataset with 2 classes and 8 data points, each with only one feature value, labeled f. Note that there are two data points with the same feature value of 6. These are shown as two xâ€™s one above the other.


Divide this data equally into two parts. Use first part as training and second part as testing. Using KNN classifier, for K=3, what would be the predicted outputs for the test samples? Show how you arrived at your answer.
Compute the confusion matrix for this and calculate accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values.
